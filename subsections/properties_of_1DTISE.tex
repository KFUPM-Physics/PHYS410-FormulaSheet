\subsection*{\underline{Properties of the Solution of 1D Stationary Schrodinger Equation:}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For 1D potential, all stationary solutions are non-degenerate.
    \item Stationary square integrable solution exist only for $E > min{(V(x))}$
    \item If V(x) is real, then $\Psi$(x) can be taken to be real.
    \item Eigenvalues of a Hermitian Hamiltonian are all real.
    \item The eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator form a complete orthogonal basis set, for smooth potentials.
    \item 1D Schrodinger equation Solution is real up to an over all phase.
    \item For a given 1D even potential the stationary states are either even or odd.
    \item The wave function and its first order space derivative are continuous all over space and in particular at the boundaries of a finite potential.
    \item At boundaries with Dirac delta function potential,
          the wave function is still continuos but the first space derivative of the wavefunction is discontinuous. 
    \item Due to square integrability, physical solution should be finite all over space, no blow ups, in particular at infinity.
    \item The number of nodes (zeros) of the eigenfunction increases by one unit between adjacent states as we move from the ground state (zero nodes) to higher excited states.
    \item Bound states exist only for confining potential (classically between turning points of the potential).
